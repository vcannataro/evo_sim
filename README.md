# evo_sim

Made a simulation of a birth-death process, similar to evolution at 
the base of intestinal crypts, to 
  1) demonstrate some relevant evolution-in-action and 
  2) learn shiny.
  
Simulation may be run locally by running evo_sim/R/Evolution_app/evolution_simulation_EM.R 

App also lives here, for now: https://vcannataro.shinyapps.io/Evolution_app/
